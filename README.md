The following is a short description of what Fire Emblem Awakening is and what the marriage system entails.

Fire Emblem Awakening is a strategy game where the player recruits units to fight in their army. In the game, a unit has a class, and can equip 5 skills in total. If possible, the player can marry two units, who will then go on to have a child. This child can recruited into the player's army. Different combinations of mother/father will lead to different results. This program lets you view what those different results are.
In game, mothers will always give birth to the same child, but fathers do not, and their child will depend on who they marry.


How to use the program:

Run the file main_code to start the program.
Once run, the user will be prompted with a 2 button menu reading "Plan" and "Review". Clicking on "Plan" will give the user 3 options, "Match" "Team" and "Back". 

Clicking on "Match" will open up a window with 3 rows, with a gap between the top and middle rows. The first row contains all the fathers in the game, the second contains all mothers, and the third contains all children. Clicking on a name will open another window, which allows the user to see who this unit's mother, father, husband, wife, or children are.

It will also allow the user to plan out what skills and class they want the selected unit to have for when they play the game. The left column contains the unit’s class options, and the right contains what skills they can equip. Some children will also have equitable skills at the bottom of the window, depending on who their parents are. Clicking on a class or skill will put them in the center of the window, indicating that they are being considered. In the game, a unit can only have 1 class and 5 skills, but for planning, this tool will allow as many as the unit has options.
To marry a father to a mother, click on the "match" button below both of their names. Once married, their child (on the bottom row) will have their respective window change, gaining different class and skill options.

Once the user is finished working on a unit, they can click on that unit’s name, then select "Finalize" from the bottom of the unit's information screen. Provided the unit built is legal, this will lock them in as being submitted, and display a new frame detailing what choices the player has made with regards to their skills, class, and family. From this new frame, the user is given an option labeled "Add to Team".

The Team can be viewed by clicking on the previously mentioned "Team" button. The Team is used to keep track of which characters the user plans on using while they play Fire Emblem Awakening. If the "Add to Team" button is clicked for a particular unit, they will be added to the team. In the game, a maximum of 15 units can be under the player's control at a time, but this tool will allow to user to exceed this number.


Alternatively, clicking on “Review” from the initial window will show 12 rows with a name above each. Each row contains a child’s name, and buttons with the names of all the possible fathers they can have. Clicking on a father’s name will open up a window that can be used to write down notes about that particular father, with that particular child.
